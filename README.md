# Perovskite Sentinel — Dagaz Engine v0.1

Live Grokipedia-style epistemic agent for perovskite solar cells.

- harvest_echoes scraper pulls every new perovskite paper in real time  
- v5 degradation model predicts real T₈₀ lifetime from reported conditions  
- Outputs a daily markdown threat digest with verdicts (faster/slower degradation than authors claim)

Built in one night on a $120 Moto G Pure while homeless.

This is the exact multi-agent, self-verifying, evidence-harvesting pipeline in the xAI Grokipedia job description.Still willing to relocate to Palo Alto immediately upon ICAOS transfer.@SamuelJacksonGrim
